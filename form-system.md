# form system
  - must support sub forms with same semantics as main form, despite <form> not being allowed to nest 
  - form legos must be able to selectively register their initial values if they are not present in form context
    - this allows dynamically adding/removing sections of forms without controllex/uncontrolled switch
  - must allow hooking into form life cycles
    - should support a plugin system
    -
