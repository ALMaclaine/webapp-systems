Certainly! Let's build upon each of the concepts you've mentioned:

## Form System

### 3. Hooking into Form Life Cycles:

- **Form Life Cycle Events**: Define clear life cycle events like `onFormInit`, `onFieldChange`, `onFormSubmit`, and `onFormReset`.

- **Plugin System**: Allow third-party plugins to be developed. Plugins can be used to extend the form's functionality, such as integrating analytics to track form interactions or adding extra validation layers.

### 5. Automatic Persistence to Multiple Data Stores:

- **Persistence Layer**: Develop an abstracted persistence layer that can support different types of data stores (e.g., Local Storage, IndexedDB, REST API, GraphQL). 

- **Adapters**: For each type of datastore, create an adapter. This adapter will be responsible for transforming the form data to a format suitable for the datastore and vice versa.

- **Offline Support**: Include functionality to detect if the user is offline. If so, store the form data locally (using Local Storage or IndexedDB) and sync when they are online.

- **Datastore Priority**: Allow developers to set a priority list for datastores. For example, try saving to a REST API first, if that fails, save to Local Storage.
