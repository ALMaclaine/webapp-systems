Certainly! Let's build upon each of the concepts you've mentioned:

## Form System

### 1. Sub Forms with Similar Semantics:

- **Shadow Forms**: Develop a concept of 'shadow forms' which can mimic the behavior of a real form but are essentially a collection of inputs. A 'shadow form' won't be a nested `<form>` but will behave like one in terms of collecting and validating data.
  
- **Parent-Child Communication**: Use custom events or a global state to allow these shadow forms to communicate with the main form. When the main form is submitted, it can collect data from all child shadow forms as well.

### 2. Initial Values Registration:

- **Form Registry**: Implement a form registry to keep track of all form legos (or form components). When a form component gets mounted and if its initial value is not present in the form context, it can register its value to this central registry.

- **Dynamic Form Sections**: Offer utilities or hooks to facilitate the dynamic addition or removal of form sections. This ensures that when sections are added, their initial state is registered, and when removed, their state is de-registered.

### 3. Hooking into Form Life Cycles:

- **Form Life Cycle Events**: Define clear life cycle events like `onFormInit`, `onFieldChange`, `onFormSubmit`, and `onFormReset`.

- **Plugin System**: Allow third-party plugins to be developed. Plugins can be used to extend the form's functionality, such as integrating analytics to track form interactions or adding extra validation layers.

### 4. Input and Output Types:

- **Transformers**: Create transformer functions that can transform the input data to a different output format. This is particularly useful when the backend expects data in a certain format which is different from the input.

- **Data Mappers**: Use data mappers to map form fields to specific data structures. This way, even if the initial data structure changes, the mapper can handle the conversion.

### 5. Automatic Persistence to Multiple Data Stores:

- **Persistence Layer**: Develop an abstracted persistence layer that can support different types of data stores (e.g., Local Storage, IndexedDB, REST API, GraphQL). 

- **Adapters**: For each type of datastore, create an adapter. This adapter will be responsible for transforming the form data to a format suitable for the datastore and vice versa.

- **Offline Support**: Include functionality to detect if the user is offline. If so, store the form data locally (using Local Storage or IndexedDB) and sync when they are online.

- **Datastore Priority**: Allow developers to set a priority list for datastores. For example, try saving to a REST API first, if that fails, save to Local Storage.

### Additional Ideas:

- **Form Versioning**: Keep track of different versions of the form. This is useful if the form structure changes over time. You can provide utilities to migrate data from an older version of the form to a newer one.

- **Form Themes**: Allow the form to be themed or styled in various ways, making it easy for developers to match the form's look and feel to their application.

- **Accessibility and Internationalization**: Ensure the form system is built with accessibility in mind. Offer utilities to make the form multilingual and comply with web accessibility standards.

- **Performance Optimizations**: Introduce lazy loading for form sections that aren't immediately needed. This can improve the initial load time for large forms.

With these suggestions, you can build a robust, extensible, and user-friendly form system. Remember to always prioritize user experience and test the system in real-world scenarios to ensure it meets users' needs.
